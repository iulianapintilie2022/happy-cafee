Happy Caffee

This is a project about a coffee shop that started selling their own products online.

For this simple website I used Javascript(framework: React), HTML of course, CSS.

I tried to do everything from scratch, including the code and even the media. For this, I used some AI Generated Images with Midjourney. 

Besides the coding, the design and the Git/Git Hub deployment, this project meant a lot of Webpack(dependencies) management(more work than the coding itself XD ) and a lot of macOS-commands and experience with the operating software.
